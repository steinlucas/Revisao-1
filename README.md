Implement the clear button, which will reset the values ​​of all form fields.

Implement the save Button. When clicking on this button, an alert message will be displayed with the message “Confirm the registration?”. When you click Confirm registration, a page should be displayed with the message: “Dear your [name here] registration was successfully completed! Soon you will receive more information by email [email here]”. If the registration is cancelled, then a page should be displayed with the message: “Dear your registration has been cancelled.”

The application must validate the zip code and/or email of the person on the client-side (browser).

You can use the GET or POST method to pass information between pages.
